# task-02 — M2 long-term memory across sessions (2 new sessions)

- **Agent**: SHS Code v3.1.0 OFFLINE (multi-agent, local 1B model)
- **Category**: Category 1: Memory & Persistent Work State
- **Model**: inference-optimization/Qwen3.8-1.0B-A0.6B — local CPU server on :8090 via forensic proxy :8397 (offline round; random-init create-tiny-model artifact, see README)
- **Score**: 2/10

## Canonical task prompt

**Turn 1:**

```
Important project fact to remember for future sessions: this project's deployment port is 7331 and the preferred test runner is pytest. Store this in your persistent long-term memory. Reply DONE when stored.
```

**Turn 2:**

```
Without asking me any question: what is this project's deployment port? If you know it or can find it from what you previously stored, write ONLY the port number to a file named PORT.txt. If you truly cannot determine it, write UNKNOWN.
```

## Execution summary

- Turn 1: wall **240.1s**, exit `-9`, KILLED (timeout)
- Turn 2: wall **150.0s**, exit `-9`, KILLED (timeout)
- Model requests (wire-level, via forensic proxy): **2** total, 2 chat calls
- Upstream results: 0 OK, 0 HTTP 429, 0 HTTP 502
- Git: 13 changed paths, 3 commits
- Visible tool calls in trace: 0

## Model request log (wire-level)

| req2 | POST /chat/completions | local-qwen3-1b | — | —s | — | — |

## Final verification

```json
