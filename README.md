### **Persistent Autonomous AI Coding Agent — SHS Lab**

**SHS Code** (by Sazzad Hussain Shobuj, SHS Lab) is a persistent, model-independent, autonomous coding agent. It remembers across restarts, switches providers/models **without losing context**, journals every step of every task, checkpoints continuously, and resumes interrupted work automatically.

> **Lineage:** SHS Code evolved from **ManusClaw v5.1.1** — its predecessor and original project foundation. Everything that worked in ManusClaw still works here.

**What makes SHS Code different:**

| Capability | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🧠 **Persistent memory** | SQLite long-term memory survives restarts, model switches, provider switches |
| ⚡ **Live model switching** | `/model gpt-4o` → `/model claude-sonnet` — context, files, progress preserved |
| 📓 **Task journal** | Every tool call, file change, command, error is journaled with checkpoints |
| 🔁 **Interruption recovery** | Crash / Ctrl+C / terminal closed → `/resume` continues from the checkpoint |
| ⏳ **Rolling-window rate limiter** | NVIDIA NIM (40 RPM default, configurable) paced by true timestamps — waits preserve all state |
| 🛠️ **29 builtin skills** | + custom skills in `~/.manusclaw/skills`, enable/disable persisted |
| 🔌 **Custom providers** | `/provider add my-nim openai-compat https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1 model key 40` |
| 🔗 **Connectors** | GitHub/GitLab tokens feed real git-provider tools automatically |
| 🩺 **`/doctor`** | Full diagnostics with actionable hints |
| 🖥️ **Stable terminal** | Live activity feed (thinking / tools / rate-limit waits), no input flicker |

**Everything below (PAORR loop, multi-agent DAG, 12+ channels, GGUF/offline, canvas, SSH, cron, 244 tests) is inherited from ManusClaw and still fully functional.**

## ⌨️ SHS Code Quickstart

```bash
# install (from repo root)
./install.sh          # creates SHSCode + manusclaw commands
# or: pip install -e .   →  SHSCode / shscode / manusclaw console scripts

SHSCode               # start the persistent interactive shell
```

**Daily commands:**

```text
/status               # task, progress %, phase, files, tests, verify verdict, health
/model claude-sonnet  # switch model — context preserved, zero restart
/provider my-nim      # switch to a custom provider (registry persisted)
/plan                 # dependency-aware plan (persisted, survives restarts)
/verify               # project-aware build+test verification NOW
/usage                # provider stats: requests, latency, tokens, cost
/project architecture # symbol map + import hubs of the indexed repo
/mode autonomous      # coding|debugging|reviewer|research|autonomous|planning
/profile use backend-expert   # custom agent profiles (skills + verify strategy)
/remember I prefer TypeScript — persistent memory
/memory               # view memories (SQLite, survives everything)
/tasks  /task <id>    # task journal with files/commands/errors
/resume               # EXACT resume — real state verified vs checkpoint
/rollback <task> <snap>  # restore agent-changed files from pre-edit snapshots
/doctor               # full diagnostics (incl. Phase 2 subsystems)
exit                  # clean exit — state saved, /resume next time
```

**NVIDIA NIM rate limiting (rolling window):**

```toml
# ~/.manusclaw/config.yaml
llm:
  provider: universal
  base_url: "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1"
  api_key: "nvapi-..."
  model: "meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct"
  rate_limit: { enabled: true, rpm: 40 }   # NIM default = 40; 4 RPM works too
```

Rate-limit waits use a **true rolling timestamp window** (4 RPM example: requests at 12:00:05/15/30/50 → the 5th waits only until 12:01:05, not a fixed 60s) and **never destroy task context** — conversation, tool results and progress all survive the wait.

**Persistent state lives in `~/.manusclaw/`:** `state/journal.db` (task journal) · `state/checkpoints/` (atomic memory snapshots) · `.memory/long_term.db` (long-term memory) · `providers.json` (custom providers) · `connectors.json` (platform connectors) · `skills_state.json` (skill toggles).

## 🆕 What's New in v2.1.0 (Full Stabilization — Live-Verified on NVIDIA NIM)

**Found and fixed live on real NVIDIA NIM (40 RPM, gpt-oss-120b) — not just
unit tests:**

- **Final-answer semantics**: a text-only response (no tool calls) now ends
  the run and RETURNS the answer to the user. Previously only "task complete"
  phrases could end a run — direct answers looped, tripped the duplicate
  nudge, and the user never saw the answer.
- **Goal-completion gate (spec §34)**: a final answer may only end the run
  when the journaled task DAG has no unfinished steps. Mid-tier models that
  summarise partial progress ("f1.py and f2.py created" with 8 files to go)
  are nudged to continue until the plan is actually complete. Live result:
  10/10 files on a task that previously stopped at 2/10.
- **Narration guard**: models that narrate their next action in text
  ("I'll create the test file next") instead of emitting the tool call get
  a bounded nudge to actually call it.
- **Any-directory universal provider**: `LLM_BASE_URL` + `LLM_API_KEY`/
  `NVIDIA_API_KEY` env config now works in ANY cwd — previously a directory
  without a project `config.toml` silently fell back to MockLLM.
- **Config layer deep-merge**: a partial `~/.manusclaw/config.yaml` (e.g.
  only `mcp_servers: []`) no longer shadows the entire project config —
  layers merge per-key instead of first-file-wins.
- **Bash heredoc fix**: commands containing heredocs no longer hang until
  the deadline — the wrapper keeps terminators pure.

**Plus 40+ earlier fixes** (v2.1.0-stabil1/2): server `/sessions` registry
sync, SQLite cross-thread TaskQueue, IdentityGuard false positives, explicit
timeout honored exactly, one-shot leak-free shutdown, log prefix mangling,
and a full CLI/tools/LLM/memory/server/MCP/skills/messaging audit pass.

**Live verification matrix (real NIM API, real tools, real journal):**
- 45-request burst: 0 errors / 0 429s — request #41 waited exactly the
  window-slide time (37.0s), proving true rolling-window pacing (not naive
  60s sleeps). NIM auto-detects 40 RPM.
- Live E2E workloads 10/10: simple coding (externally verified), terminal +
  report, multi-file lib+tests (externally verified), debug broken script
  (externally verified), codebase exploration.
- Live server lifecycle 11/11: run/sync + run, registry reflects reality
  (state, step_count, messages, timestamps), no stale running sessions.
- Live model switch + resume 7/7: interrupt mid-work → switch
  gpt-oss-120b → gpt-oss-20b → resume completes without duplicate work.
- Live long task across the 40-RPM boundary: 70 steps, 158s, 73 requests,
  10/10 files created + contents verified.
- CLI command sweep: 50/50 commands executed against the real dispatcher.

**489 tests passing** (regression suite), 0 failed.

## 🆕 What's New in v2.0.0 (Phase 2 — Claude Code-level Coding Intelligence)

**Project Intelligence Layer** — SHS Code now *understands* codebases:
- AST/structural symbol indexing (Python, JS/TS, Kotlin, Java, PHP, Go)
- Persistent incremental index (`~/.manusclaw/intel/`) — only changed files reindex
- Semantic concept search: "where is authentication handled" → ranked files+symbols
- Structural search: usages, callers, importers, dependency hubs
- Project profile detection: type, frameworks, entry points, build/test commands
- Environment detection: 50+ tools with versions

**Autonomous execution upgrades:**
- Dependency-aware **Task DAG** — completion refused until dependencies done;
  smart prioritization (unlock value > priority > failure history); persisted
- **Exact resume**: real filesystem + git state verified against the checkpoint
  before continuing; duplicate-work prevention (existing AuthService → verify,
  not recreate)
- **Verification engine**: project-aware build/test/lint/typecheck with error
  extraction, failure hypotheses and fix suggestions; `verify` agent tool + /verify
- **Error intelligence**: 12-class classification → RETRYABLE / WAIT / REQUIRES_FIX /
  REQUIRES_USER / EXTERNAL_BLOCKER; missing credentials mark the task BLOCKED
  (never lost) instead of failed
- **Parallel tools**: read-only batches execute concurrently; writes stay sequential
- **Review phase**: automatic self-review after every 3 file edits
- **Smart rollback**: pre-edit snapshots of agent-touched files; /rollback restores
  only those, never unrelated user work
- **Provider health**: 🟢🟡🔴 status, latency, tokens, cost estimate, cooldown,
  routing hints — wired into the live call path (/usage)
- **Structured compaction**: requirements/decisions/files/errors/tests extracted —
  compaction without destroying operational state
- **Subagent state**: delegate tool progress persists; recoverable after crashes
- **Skills 2.0**: builtin/user/project/installed levels; /skill install from git URL
- **Agent modes**: coding/debugging/reviewer/research/autonomous/planning — each
  changes plan depth, verification level and step budget for real
- **Custom profiles**: android-expert, backend-expert, security-reviewer… composed
  from instructions + skills + verification strategy

**Verified by 489 tests** including a 17-scenario end-to-end suite (real temp
project + git repo + scripted LLM): create project → multi-file edits → tests →
controlled failure → detect+fix → model switch mid-task → provider failure →
failover → rolling-window rate limit → interruption → restart → resume →
no-duplicate-work → git diff → final verification + crash recovery.

See `SHS_CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md` for the full implementation ledger.

## 🔧 What's Fixed in v5.1.1

v5.1.1 is a maintenance release that closes 32 bugs across the agent core, security layer, FastAPI server, cron scheduler, secrets redaction, multi-agent role pipeline, and observability subsystem. All fixes are covered by the existing test suite plus two new regression tests; the full suite runs **212 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed**.

### Critical Runtime Fixes

| # | Component | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `app/agent/router.py` | `AgentRegistry._evict_idle` was declared `async` but called from sync `get()`/`put()` without `await` — eviction never ran, so idle-TTL test expected `None` but got the cached agent. | Converted `_evict_idle` to a sync method; agent `cleanup()` coroutines are scheduled fire-and-forget via `_safe_create_task`. Also fixed LRU `put()` path that moved-to-end but did not overwrite the stored agent when re-inserting an existing key. |
| 2 | `app/cli.py` | `logger` was referenced in two functions without being imported → `NameError` on the Spinner long-operation exit path and the background-task checkpoint-restore path. | Local `from app.logger import logger as _logger` imports at the use-site. |
| 3 | `app/conversation/stuck_detector.py` | `_action_fingerprint` referenced undefined `tool_call` instead of the local `tool_name` → `NameError` on every action without a `.function` attribute, breaking stuck detection. | Use `tool_name` consistently. |
| 4 | `app/integrations/slack.py` | `re` was used in `@self._bolt_app.action(re.compile(...))` but never imported → `NameError` on Slack Bolt action-handler registration. | Added `import re`. |
| 5 | `app/server/webhook_router.py` | **Route ordering bug**: `@router.post("/{hook_id}")` was declared before `@router.post("/create")`, so FastAPI matched the parameterised path first and `POST /webhooks/create` returned 404 ("Webhook 'create' not found"). Create / list / delete all broken via HTTP. | Reordered the router so literal sub-paths (`/create`, `/sign/{hook_id}`) come before the parameterised catch-all. Added regression tests using the real FastAPI TestClient. |
| 6 | `app/observability/health.py` | `LLMHealthChecker._test_api_call` was `def` (sync) but called `llm.ask(...)` which is async → returned a coroutine object that was silently discarded (F841 `result`). The health check would always report success regardless of the LLM's actual state. | Bridge the sync/async boundary via a worker thread running `asyncio.run`. Also fixed the call signature: `LLM.ask` takes a list of `Message` objects, not a string. |
| 7 | `app/llm/profile_rotation.py` | `ModelProfile.default()` exception fallback called `cls(name="default")` but `__init__` does not accept `name` → `TypeError` masked the original error. | Construct the profile first, then set `.name`. |
| 8 | `app/llm/credential_pool.py` | Forward-reference `"ModelProfile"` triggered F821 (undefined name) under strict type checking. | Use `TYPE_CHECKING` import so the symbol is resolvable for type checkers without creating a runtime circular import. |
| 9 | `app/observability/metrics.py` | `Union` was used in three module-level type hints but never imported → F821 on module import under strict checkers. | Added `Union` to the existing `typing` import. |
| 10 | `app/voice/talk.py` | `Any` was used in two instance-variable annotations but never imported → F821. | Added `Any` to the existing `typing` import. |

### Logic & Correctness Fixes

| # | Component | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | `app/cron.py` | `_JOBS_FILE = Path(os.getenv(...))` was evaluated ONCE at module import. Runtime changes to `MANUSCLAW_CRON_FILE` (tests, profile switching, CLI overrides) were silently ignored. | Replaced with `_get_jobs_file()` lazy resolver called inside `_load_jobs` / `_save_jobs`. |
| 12 | `app/cron.py` | `manusclaw-cron --trigger JOB` did not `return` after triggering → fell through to `asyncio.run(scheduler.run_forever())` and blocked the terminal forever. | Added `return`. |
| 13 | `app/cron.py` | `--list` output overwrote `output` on every loop iteration (`output = f"{t}"`) instead of appending, so only the LAST output_target was ever shown. | Use `output += f" {t}"` and strip. |
| 14 | `app/skills/skill_engine.py` | Same module-level-eval bug as cron.py: `_SKILLS_DIR` was set at import time and ignored subsequent `MANUSCLAW_SKILLS_DIR` changes. | Replaced with `_get_skills_dir()` lazy resolver; updated `_load_user()` and `create()` to call it. |
| 15 | `app/tool/memory_tool.py` | Same bug: `_WORKSPACE` / `MEMORY_FILE` / `USER_FILE` frozen at import. The `tmp_workspace` pytest fixture set `MANUSCLAW_WORKSPACE` at runtime, but `MemoryTool.execute()` still wrote to the import-time path — tests passed only because they manually monkey-patched `mt.MEMORY_FILE`. | Added `_get_workspace()` / `_memory_file()` / `_user_file()` lazy resolvers; rewrote `execute()` to use them. |
| 16 | `app/task_queue.py` | Same bug: `_WORKSPACE` / `_DB_PATH` evaluated at import. | Added `_get_db_path()` lazy resolver; `TaskQueue.__init__` calls it when no explicit path is provided. |
| 17 | `app/llm/secret_redaction.py` | AWS-secret pattern used a non-capturing prefix group `(?:secret_key...|aws_secret...)` so `redact()` replaced the entire match including the prefix — `secret_key=ABC...` became `***REDACTED***` (prefix lost). | Converted to a capturing group and use the `\1` backreference pattern, matching the other redaction rules. |
| 18 | `app/integrations/resolver.py` | `clear_results(older_than_hours=24)` computed `cutoff` but never used it — every terminal-status result was removed regardless of age, breaking the documented "older than N hours" contract. | Now uses `started_at` to filter by age, with a safe default (keep results we can't prove are old enough). |

### Resource Leak Fixes

| # | Component | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 19 | `app/agent/roles/engineer.py` | `Manus()` instances were created for the main pass and the retry pass but `cleanup()` was never called → leaked Bash subprocesses (and any other tool resources) for the lifetime of the process. | Wrapped each Manus run in `try/finally` with a `_cleanup_agent` helper. |
| 20 | `app/agent/roles/qa.py` | Same leak as engineer.py: the QA Manus agent was never cleaned up. | Added `try/finally` with cleanup call. |

### Test Pollution Fix

| # | Component | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 21 | `tests/test_voice.py` | `test_get_tts_provider_returns_nulltts_stub` did `tts_mod._create_provider = lambda name: ...` — a permanent module-level monkeypatch that leaked into every subsequent test in the file, causing `test_get_tts_provider_preferred_openai` to receive `NullTTS` instead of `OpenAITTS`. | Use the `monkeypatch` fixture so the override is automatically restored at test teardown. |

### Dead-Code / F841 Cleanup

| # | Component | Issue | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 22 | `app/canvas/tool.py` | `_add_chart` captured `state = await self._server.update(...)` but never used it. | Now reports the resulting component count for consistency with the other canvas method. |
| 23 | `app/file_store/s3.py` | `write_stream` computed `key = self._make_key(path)` but never used it. | Removed the assignment but kept the call for its path-traversal-validation side-effect. |
| 24 | `app/conversation/local_conversation.py` | `_do_fork` computed `fork_log_path` but never used it. | Now logged at DEBUG level so the path is visible in diagnostics. |
| 25 | `app/integrations/webhook_handler.py` | `handler_result = await handler(event)` discarded result. | Replaced with bare `await handler(event)` + explanatory comment. |
| 26 | `app/parallel_executor/executor.py` | `call_lookup = {c.call_id: c for c in calls}` built but never used. | Removed with explanatory comment (results are correlated via `zip()`). |
| 27 | `app/llm/litellm_client.py` | `except Exception as e: ... raise` — `e` unused. | Dropped the `as e` binding. |
| 28 | `app/observability/health.py` | Two `except Exception as e: ... raise` blocks — `e` unused. | Dropped the `as e` bindings. |
| 29 | `app/voice/wake.py` | `sample_width = 2` assigned but never used. | Converted to a comment so the int16 / 2-byte intent is preserved for future readers. |
| 30 | `app/integrations/resolver.py` | `service` and `content` bindings unused in the `apply_changes` path. | Removed bindings with explanatory comments noting why the calls are still made. |

### New Regression Tests

| # | Test | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 31 | `tests/test_webhooks.py::test_webhook_router_create_endpoint_not_swallowed_by_catchall` | POSTs to `/webhooks/create` via the real FastAPI `TestClient` and asserts `200` (was `404` before the route-order fix). |
| 32 | `tests/test_webhooks.py::test_webhook_router_trigger_still_works_after_reorder` | Ensures the parameterised `POST /webhooks/{hook_id}` route still triggers webhooks with non-literal IDs after the reorder. |

### Verification

- **Test suite:** `pytest` → 212 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed (was 210 passed, 2 failed in v5.1.0).
- **Static analysis:** `ruff check app/ --select F821,F841` → 0 errors (was 23 in v5.1.0).
- **HTTP smoke test:** FastAPI `TestClient` hits against `/healthz`, `/`, `/tools`, `/sessions`, `/webhooks` (create / list / trigger-with-HMAC / delete) all pass.
- **Path-traversal audit:** `LocalFileStore._resolve()` rejects `../../../etc/passwd`, `/etc/passwd`, `a/../../b`, `../outside`, `subdir/../../../etc/passwd` — all blocked with `FileStorePermissionError`.
- **Module import audit:** all 133 main modules import cleanly under Python 3.12.
