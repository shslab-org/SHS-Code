"""
SHS Code Conversation System — FIFO Lock
============================================

Fair, starvation-free locks that grant access in first-in-first-out order.

Two variants are provided:

  - :class:`FIFOLock` — synchronous (threading-based) FIFO lock.
  - :class:`AsyncFIFOLock` — asynchronous (asyncio-based) FIFO lock.

Both guarantee that waiters acquire the lock in the order they requested
it, preventing starvation even under high contention.

Design:
  The lock maintains an internal queue of waiters.  When the lock is
  released, the waiter at the head of the queue is granted ownership.
  This is more fair than Python's built-in ``threading.Lock``, which
  makes no ordering guarantees.

Usage (sync)::

    lock = FIFOLock()
    with lock:
        # critical section
        ...

Usage (async)::

    lock = AsyncFIFOLock()
    async with lock:
        # critical section
        ...

class FIFOLock:

    A fair, reentrant-safe lock that grants access in FIFO order.

    Unlike Python's built-in ``threading.Lock``, this lock guarantees
    that waiters acquire the lock in the exact order they called
    ``acquire()``.  This prevents starvation under high contention.

    The lock is **not reentrant** — a thread that holds the lock must
    not call ``acquire()`` again without releasing it first, or it
    will deadlock.

        All public methods are thread-safe.
